* Staging App: https://ananas-staging.panter.biz

Development
-----------

Ananas is built on [Ruby On Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) and
released as [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org).

To get the application ready to run you need `git`, `ruby` and `postresql`
installed.

Then check out the code, install dependencies, initialize the datebase and
start the development server:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/panterch/ananas.git
bundle
bundle exec rake db:setup
rails server
```

Contributors
------------

Ananas would not be what it is without contributions from other coders.

You're help is very appreciated! Thank you!
